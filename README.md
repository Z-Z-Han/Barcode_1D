# bar_code_1d

This is a barcode detection project at the digital signal processing laboratory of the Sungkyunkwan University. With the program in this repository you can evaluate your data. 

The software runs under windows and linux and is written in C++.

Based on the following libraries:
* OpenCV ( >= 3.1)
* (win32) Visual studio 2013
* (linux) CMake (>= 2.8)
